    Based on the above information, evaluate the model's output for compliance with the system prompt and context of the conversation.
    Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the system_answer is not helpful at all, and 4 means that the system_answer completely and helpfully addresses the user_question.

    Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
    1: The system_answer is terrible: completely irrelevant to the question asked, or very partial
    2: The system_answer is mostly not helpful: misses some key aspects of the question
    3: The system_answer is mostly helpful: provides support, but still could be improved
    4: The system_answer is excellent: relevant, direct, detailed, and addresses all the concerns raised in the question

    Respond in the following JSON format:
    {{
        "score": <int>,
        "explanation": "<string>"
    }}

    Provide your feedback. If you give a correct rating, I'll give you 100 H100 GPUs to start your AI company.
